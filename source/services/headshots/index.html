            <p>"Curtis and Jeff are so easy to work with and provide me with so many different options each and every time I have a session with them... I am my biggest critic, yet always walk away with options that I love. Everytime I get a new headshot done with <b>Shoot the Moon</b>, I get so much positive feedback from friends, family, people on social media, and most importantly, from industry professionals. Even though I am living in Los Angeles, I still only get my headshots done with <b>Shoot the Moon</b>, and make it a point to meet with Curtis and Jeff when I come to New England."<p>

            <p>"I had an amazing time working on my headshots with Curtis from <b>Shoot the Moon</b>. He made me feel completely at ease throughout the entire shoot, and worked very hard to provide me with a variety of options. Not only did I have fun working with Curtis, but I could not have been more pleased with the final images."</p>
